What I did
-----------

    Build an app called SimpleVideoView that plays a video clip by using the VideoView and MediaController classes.
    Preserve the playback position for the video playback across activity state changes.
    React to the end of the video playback with an event listener.
    Handle the time period in my app where the media is being prepared (buffering or decoding), and provide a helpful message to the user.
    Play media files as embedded files in the app, or streamed from the internet
